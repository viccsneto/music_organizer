**Instructions for @github-copilot reviewer:**
> 
> This repository implements **Mastery-Aware Pipelines** to prevent Cognitive Bypass. Before approving this PR, you MUST:
> 
> 1. **Read these artifacts in order:**
>    - `brainsback/TODO.md` — Strategic plan
>    - `brainsback/REPORT.md` — Implementation summary
>    - `brainsback/REACTO.md` — Proof of mastery
> 
> 2. **Verify mastery by checking:**
>    - Does `REACTO.md` demonstrate deep understanding (not surface-level)?
>    - Are edge cases and trade-offs explicitly discussed?
>    - Does the code diff align with the plan in `TODO.md`?
>    - Does `REPORT.md` accurately describe what changed and why?
> 
> 3. **Ask Socratic questions** about:
>    - Concurrency and race conditions
>    - Failure modes and error handling
>    - Performance implications
>    - Alternative approaches considered
> 
> 4. **Red flags for Cognitive Bypass:**
>    - Empty or template-only `REACTO.md`
>    - Vague explanations like "it just works"
>    - Missing discussion of trade-offs
>    - No mention of edge cases or tests
> 
> **Your role:** Test the developer's mental model, don't just approve the code.
